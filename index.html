            <h2>What is time complexity?</h2>
            <p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to
                run as a function of the size of the input. It is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm grows as
                the size of the input grows.</p>
            <p>Time complexity is typically expressed using big O notation, which describes the upper bound on the
                runtime of an algorithm in terms of the size of the input. For example, an algorithm with a time
                complexity of O(n) has a runtime that grows linearly with the size of the input, while an algorithm with
                a time complexity of O(n^2) has a runtime that grows quadratically with the size of the input.</p>
            <p>Understanding time complexity is important for analyzing the efficiency of algorithms and for comparing
                different algorithms for the same problem. By analyzing the time complexity of an algorithm, we can
                determine how the algorithm will perform on large inputs and make informed decisions about which
                algorithm to use in a given situation.</p>
